1. Project Overview
This document outlines the development plan for a real-time streaming and VOD (Video On Demand) platform that combines features from Twitch.tv and YouTube. The project will include live broadcasting, real-time chat, a Superchat-like donation system, and the ability to upload and view pre-recorded videos. The goal is to deploy the service on Heroku, use a PostgreSQL database, and integrate with a free CDN for a stable and scalable platform.

2. Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js (with Express.js)

Database: PostgreSQL (Heroku Postgres)

Deployment: Heroku

Live Streaming Server: Nginx-rtmp-module or Node-Media-Server (for RTMP stream ingestion and processing)

CDN: Cloudflare (for accelerating content delivery of both live streams and VODs)

VOD Storage: Amazon S3 or another object storage service (for storing large video files)

3. Core Features & Implementation Details
Frontend
User Interface: An intuitive UI optimized for content viewing and discovery. The design will be responsive to provide a consistent user experience across various devices, including PCs, mobile phones, and tablets.

Key Components:

Home Page: Displays personalized content such as followed channels, recommended live streams, and popular VODs.

Stream Page (Live Broadcasting):

A high-quality, real-time video player (utilizing HTML5 <video> or libraries like hls.js, dash.js).

A real-time chat component (WebSocket-based), with consideration for additional features like emojis and user badges.

A streamer info panel for displaying details, donation links, and social media.

A Superchat UI to allow users to donate with custom messages.

VOD Page (Recorded Videos):

A video player for watching uploaded content.

A comment section, as well as like and dislike buttons.

A related video recommendation feature.

Upload Page: An intuitive interface for users to upload video files and set a title, description, and thumbnail.

User Authentication: Basic user authentication and management features, including sign-up, login, profile management, and password reset.

Backend
RESTful API: Designed for communication with the frontend (e.g., /api/users, /api/streams, /api/videos, /api/superchats, /api/comments).

WebSocket Server: Implemented for real-time chat and Superchat notifications.

Authentication & Authorization: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used to manage user authentication and sessions, and to control permissions for streaming and VOD uploads.

PostgreSQL Schema:

users: id, username, email, password_hash, profile_image_url, created_at

streams: id, user_id (FK), title, current_viewers, is_live, started_at, ended_at (live stream info)

videos: id, user_id (FK), title, description, thumbnail_url, video_url, view_count, upload_date, duration (VOD info)

superchats: id, user_id (FK), stream_id (FK), amount, message, timestamp

comments: id, video_id (FK), user_id (FK), text_content, timestamp (VOD comments)

likes_dislikes: id, video_id (FK), user_id (FK), type (e.g., 'like', 'dislike'), timestamp

Heroku Integration:

The Node.js application will be deployed to a Heroku dyno.

A Procfile will define the command to run the application.

package.json will list all necessary dependencies.

The Heroku Postgres add-on will be provisioned to easily integrate the database.

Sensitive information (DB credentials, API keys, etc.) will be securely managed using Heroku's Config Vars.

Live Streaming & CDN
RTMP Server:

A dedicated media server will be set up on the backend to receive RTMP streams from broadcasters using software like OBS.

Ingested streams will be transcoded into various resolutions and bitrates to provide optimal quality based on the viewer's network conditions.

CDN (Content Delivery Network) Configuration:

A free CDN like Cloudflare will be used to efficiently distribute both live streams and VOD content to a global audience.

The public IP of the RTMP server will be configured as the origin for live content.

The VOD storage (e.g., an Amazon S3 bucket) will also be set as an origin for recorded videos.

Frontend video players will fetch content from the CDN URLs, minimizing latency and improving loading speeds.

VOD Functionality
Video Upload & Processing:

When a user uploads a video via the web interface, the backend server will receive the file.

The file will be securely stored in scalable object storage like Amazon S3.

Video Transcoding: The original video will be processed by a transcoding pipeline to convert it into various resolutions (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p) and streaming formats (e.g., HLS, DASH) for optimal viewing across all devices.

VOD Hosting & Delivery:

The transcoded video files will be stored in the object storage and cached by the CDN for fast delivery worldwide.

The video_url in the PostgreSQL videos table will point to the CDN-enabled URL of the video file.

Viewers will stream the VOD content directly from the CDN.

4. Development Workflow
Setup Heroku Project: Create a new Heroku app and provision necessary add-ons like Heroku Postgres.

Backend Development:

Build the RESTful APIs and WebSocket server.

Design and create the PostgreSQL database tables for users, streams, videos, superchats, comments, and likes/dislikes.

Integrate the RTMP media server for live streaming.

Implement the VOD upload logic, including secure storage to Amazon S3 and the transcoding pipeline.

Frontend Development:

Develop the React components for the UI/UX, including dedicated pages for live streams and VODs.

Implement the video upload interface.

Connect the frontend to the backend APIs and WebSocket server to support all live and VOD interactions.

Deployment: Push the code to the Heroku Git remote for automatic deployment.

CDN & VOD Integration: Configure the chosen CDN service for both live stream and VOD delivery, and conduct thorough testing of content distribution.
